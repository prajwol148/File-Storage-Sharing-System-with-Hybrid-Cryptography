Welcome to the Optimized File Storage and Sharing System with Robust Security using Hybrid Cryptography in Java! 🚀

In today's rapidly evolving computing landscape, ensuring the security of file storage and sharing is paramount. Our project aims to address this need by designing and implementing a robust hybrid cryptographic solution.

🛡️ Leveraging the power of Java programming language and a client-server architecture, our system combines the strengths of public-key cryptography (RSA), symmetric-key cryptography (AES), and hashing algorithms (SHA) to guarantee data security and integrity.

🔒 With file segmentation into encrypted chunks, digital signatures, and secure key exchange facilitated by a trusted center, our system minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

📚 Developed as part of Advanced Computer Networks and Security coursework, our project underscores the importance of network security, focusing not only on confidentiality but also on integrity and authenticity.

🔍 Through rigorous testing and evaluation, we aspire to contribute to the advancement of more secure and efficient file storage and sharing systems, with broad implications across various use cases.
